title: Libwary V2.0

  After making a horrendous libwary in php for hackac24, I decided to remake one in python.
  This time, there are credits, to ensure you can only read one book at once (don't be greedy), and ensure you can't read the flag.
  Also, I've outright disabled reading the flag this time, so it should be impossible.

flag: ACSI{r4c3d_t0_p0llut3_l1br4r9_w1t7_3xtr4_p4r4m5_4t_sp333333d}
